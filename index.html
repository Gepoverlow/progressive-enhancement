        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>
          Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
          evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
          <q class="villager"
            >We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.</q
          >
          The farmer said,<q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the horse
          came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
          everybody came back and said,<q class="villager"
            >Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have
            eight horses!</q
          >
          The farmer again said,<q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The following day
          his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was
          thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<q class="villager"
            >Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,</q
          >
          and the farmer responded,<q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the
          conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
          and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the
          neighbors came around and said,<q class="villager"
            >Isn’t that great!</q
          >
          Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The whole process of
          nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
          impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
          <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark> —
          because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
          or, you never know what will be the consequences of
          <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.
