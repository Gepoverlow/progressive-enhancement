        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>
          Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
          evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
          “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
          unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came
          back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody
          came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of
          events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Maybe.”
          The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
          riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
          “Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,” and the farmer
          responded, “Maybe.” The next day the conscription officers came around
          to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because
          he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
          “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Maybe.” The whole process of
          nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
          impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
          <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark> —
          because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
          or, you never know what will be the consequences of
          <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.

          <mark class="good">Good</mark> and <mark class="bad">Bad</mark> are

          bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
